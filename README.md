## Credit

This tool/script is strongly inspired by [PID-Analyzer](https://github.com/Plasmatree/PID-Analyzer) and [PIDtoolbox](https://github.com/bw1129/PIDtoolbox), so thanks goes to all those whom have contributed to PID-analyzer and PIDtoolbox.

Origins for this repo (Thanks!):

- Plasmatree (for PID-Analyzer),
- Brian White (for PIDtoolbox),
- ColinNiu (for pyPIDtoolbox)

Big thanks to current and past contributors:

- Chiang, Hugo (DusKing) - optimizing many details to make it scientific and usable
- ColinNiu - for the surprising framework
